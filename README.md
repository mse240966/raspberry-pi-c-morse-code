# Raspberry Pi C Morse Code

A little C program written on my Raspberry Pi to brush up on my aging C programming language knowledge, and to learn GPIO output programming in C on the Raspberry PI.  I didn't want to use a third party library, but learn how to control GPIO output manually. So I opted for the 'sysfs interface'. Refer to the wiki page <https://github.com/mse240966/raspberry-pi-c-morse-code/wiki> for more information.  I had already done a small project with four leds, so this time a buzzer and Morse code!

## Example

```bash
$ sudo ./morseCode
```
